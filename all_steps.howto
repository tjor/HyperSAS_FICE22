# extract data to digital counts using satcon

# update input_parameters_hsas.m for this cruise, including functions for reading ship's data

# apply calibration coefficients (can be pre and post, or only pre)
calibrate_hsas.m

# run L0 and L1 processing (slowest part because it requires working functions to read ship's data)
proc_L0_L1.m

# run L2 processing
proc_L2.m

# plot L2 data
amt_L2_plot.m

# create netCDF files
need to complete this
