- You find here the f factor and f/Q values, calculated WITH Raman effect
- f values are in the file f.dat
- f/Q values are distributed in several files, located in directory D_foQ_pa
- please read the file foQ.info
- You can find also the Rgothic factor in the file rgoth_Ebuchi.dat;
  first column : wind speed (xx for a flat ocean)
  second column : nadir angle (under water)
  third column : Rgothic
- The tar archive "lin-approx.tar" contains 6 files
  table.f0 and table.Sf, table.Q0 and table.SQn, table.fOQ0 and table.SfOQn
    The f factor is linearly related to cos(tetas) for tetas <= 60 deg.
      (tetas is the sun zenith angle) according to :
                f = f0 + Sf * (1-cos(tetas))
      table.f0 and table.Sf give the values of f0 and Sf
        for various wavelengths and Chl-concentrations.
    The same analysis is repeated for the parameter Qn (the Q factor at nadir)
                Qn = Q0 + SQn * (1-cos(tetas))
      table.Q0 and table.SQn give the values of Q0 and SQn
    And for the ratio f/Qn (valid for tetas <= 75 deg.)
                f/Qn = f0/Q0 + SfOQn * (1-cos(tetas))
      table.fOQ0 and table.SfOQn give the values of f0/Q0 and SfOQn

For your convenience (this is not mandatory however),
would you want to concatenate all f/Q files in one single file,
just type the unix command << make >>, in order to :
1) concatenate all f/Q files in a single file named foq.dat
2) build an include file foq.h for a fortran program named read_foQ.f; 
3) compile and execute program read_foQ :
   this program reads the foq.dat and f.dat files and produces a file
   called values.dat; just compare this file with file values0.dat
   to ensure that everything went well.

N.B. :
On SUN-SOLARIS it is necessary to change << awk >> by << nawk >>
in script file foQ.f77
